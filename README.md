    steps:
      - name: Use tools
        run: |

          vault --version
          mongosh --version
```

## üõ† Included Scripts

The container includes helpful network diagnostic scripts located in the root directory, useful for troubleshooting and validating connectivity in DevOps workflows:

- `load.sh` - Network load generation and basic DNS query testing
- `lookup_test.sh` - Automated DNS lookup and latency checks for network troubleshooting

## üîß Dependency Management

This repository uses **Renovate** for automated dependency updates that go beyond what Dependabot can handle.

### What's Managed by Renovate

- **HashiCorp Vault**: Automatically tracks and updates the `VAULT_VERSION` environment variable in the Dockerfile
- Monitors `hashicorp/vault` GitHub releases and creates pull requests when new versions are available

### What's Managed by Dependabot

- **Base Docker Images**: Updates `FROM` instructions (e.g., `debian:trixie-backports`)
- Standard package ecosystem dependencies

### How It Works

Renovate uses regex managers to parse the Dockerfile and identify version variables that need tracking:

```dockerfile
ENV VAULT_VERSION=1.18.3
```

When a new Vault release is published, Renovate will automatically:
1. Create a branch with the updated version
2. Open a pull request with the changes
3. Include release notes and changelogs

The Renovate workflow runs daily at 2 AM UTC and can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab.

## üîÑ Release Process

This repository uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated release management. Releases are automatically created based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

To trigger a release:
1. Commit changes using conventional commit format (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)
2. Push to the `main` branch
3. Release Please will automatically create a pull request for the next release
4. When the release PR is merged, a new release will be created

## üìù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please ensure your commits follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for automatic release management.
